#Usage

The code also generates code corresponding to all the gui elements. The generated code is basically function stubs. Generated code example shown below:
```python
def on_button1a_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_button2a_click(event, appstate, /):
    print('app action on button2a')
    pass

def on_button1b_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_button2b_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_text1a_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_text1b_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_text2a_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass

def on_text2b_click(event, appstate, /):
    pass
```

Already generated or manually create function stubs are left as is.
